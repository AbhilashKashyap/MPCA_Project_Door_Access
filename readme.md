Arduino Sketch showing Door Access Control featuring RFID, EEPROM, Ultrasonic Sensor

Hardware Used

Arduino Uno
MFRC 522 NFC RFID Chip
HR-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
12 RPM DC Motor
MQ-2 Gas Sensor
Jumper Cables

The repository has two demo videos to show the working of the project under /Demos
Project Code is under /Project

The Project Code is based on Miquel Balboa's MFRC 522 Example Codes and the corresponding libraries need to be added to Arduino IDE before using.
RC 522 can be searched in the IDE's Library Selector or can be downloaded from https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid
